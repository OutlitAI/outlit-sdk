Agent skills teach AI agents how to work with Outlit — best practices, decision frameworks, and integration patterns. The [MCP server](/ai-integrations/mcp) gives agents _tools_; skills give them _knowledge_ about how to use those tools well.

Skills are open source at [github.com/OutlitAI/outlit-agent-skills](https://github.com/OutlitAI/outlit-agent-skills).

## Install

```bash
outlit setup skills
```

Auto-detects your package runner and installs `outlit-cli` and `outlit-sdk` skills. No API key required. Also runs automatically as part of `outlit setup`.

Or install manually:

```bash
npx -y skills add https://github.com/OutlitAI/outlit-agent-skills --skill outlit-cli --skill outlit-sdk -y -g
```

## Verify

```bash
outlit doctor
```

```
  ✓ Agent Skills: Outlit agent skills installed
```
