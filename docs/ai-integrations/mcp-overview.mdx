## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is an open standard that lets AI tools connect to external data sources. Outlit's MCP server gives AI agents like Claude, Cursor, and others direct access to your customer intelligence data.

Instead of switching between your AI tool and the Outlit dashboard, your AI agent can query customers, pull revenue metrics, inspect activity timelines, and run SQL analytics -- all from within your conversation.

## What You Can Do

With the Outlit MCP integration, AI agents can:

- **Search and filter customers** by billing status, activity recency, and revenue
- **Browse users** by journey stage, activity, and customer association
- **Pull complete customer profiles** including users, revenue, timeline, and behavior metrics
- **Inspect activity timelines** filtered by channel and event type
- **Run SQL queries** against your ClickHouse analytics data
- **Explore table schemas** to write informed queries

## Available Tools
