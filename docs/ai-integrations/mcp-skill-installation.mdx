## What is an MCP Skill?

A skill is a set of contextual instructions that an AI agent can load automatically when relevant. The Outlit MCP skill teaches your AI agent how to write effective queries, understand response formats, and follow best practices when working with Outlit data.

Without the skill, your AI agent can still call the MCP tools, but it relies on the tool descriptions alone. With the skill installed, your agent gets:

- **Query patterns** for common workflows (finding at-risk customers, revenue analysis, etc.)
- **SQL examples** for the ClickHouse analytics tables
- **Response format documentation** so the agent knows what fields to expect
- **Troubleshooting guidance** for common errors

## Installation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    Skills in Claude Code are directories containing a `SKILL.md` file. You can install the Outlit MCP skill from the public GitHub repository.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Clone the skill">
        Clone the skill into your personal skills directory so it's available across all projects:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/OutlitAI/outlit-agent-skills.git /tmp/outlit-skills
        cp -r /tmp/outlit-skills/skills/outlit-mcp ~/.claude/skills/outlit-mcp
        rm -rf /tmp/outlit-skills
        ```

        Or add it as a project-level skill (available only in one project):

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/OutlitAI/outlit-agent-skills.git /tmp/outlit-skills
        cp -r /tmp/outlit-skills/skills/outlit-mcp .claude/skills/outlit-mcp
        rm -rf /tmp/outlit-skills
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Verify the skill is loaded">
        Start a new Claude Code session and ask:

        ```
        What Outlit skills are available?
        ```

        Claude should list the `outlit-mcp` skill. You can also invoke it directly:

        ```
        /outlit-mcp
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Note>
      **Personal vs. project skills:** Skills in `~/.claude/skills/` are available in all your projects. Skills in `.claude/skills/` within a project are shared with anyone who clones the repository.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Claude Desktop / Other Tools">
    The Outlit MCP skill is designed for Claude Code. For Claude Desktop and other AI tools, the MCP tools themselves include descriptions that guide the AI agent. No additional skill installation is needed.

    If your AI tool supports a skill or plugin system, check the [Outlit Agent Skills repository](https://github.com/OutlitAI/outlit-agent-skills) for available integrations.

## What the Skill Provides

The Outlit MCP skill includes contextual documentation organized into several areas:

### Query Patterns

Common workflows like:
- Finding customers at risk of churning (paying but inactive)
- Identifying high-value customers by MRR
- Tracking user journey progression
- Analyzing engagement trends over time

### SQL Reference

Example queries for the ClickHouse analytics tables:
- Event aggregation and filtering
- Revenue trend analysis with `mrr_snapshots`
- Customer and user dimension lookups
- Time-series analysis patterns

### Response Formats

Documentation for what fields each tool returns, helping the agent format data clearly and reference the right fields.

### Troubleshooting

Guidance for common issues like:
- Authentication errors
- Empty result sets
- Query timeouts
- Parameter validation errors

## Keeping the Skill Updated

To update the skill to the latest version:

```bash
# Personal skills
cd ~/.claude/skills/outlit-mcp
git pull origin main

# Or re-copy from a fresh clone
git clone https://github.com/OutlitAI/outlit-agent-skills.git /tmp/outlit-skills
cp -r /tmp/outlit-skills/skills/outlit-mcp ~/.claude/skills/outlit-mcp
rm -rf /tmp/outlit-skills
```
