## What is the Outlit MCP Server?

Outlit's MCP server lets AI agents query your customer data directly through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP), an open standard for connecting AI tools to external data sources. Supported agents include Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible client.

Once connected, your AI agent can search customers, pull revenue metrics, inspect activity timelines, search customer context using natural language, and run SQL analytics — all from within your conversation.

## Install the Claude Code Skill

For Claude Code users, install the [Outlit MCP skill](https://github.com/OutlitAI/outlit-agent-skills) to give your agent deeper context about query patterns, best practices, and the ability to help you complete the setup below:

```bash
npx skills add OutlitAI/outlit-agent-skills
```

## How to Connect Your AI Tool

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your API key">
    Go to [Settings > MCP Integration](https://app.outlit.ai/workspace-profile/mcp) in the Outlit dashboard. Click **Generate API Key**, give it a descriptive name, and copy it immediately — it won't be shown again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your AI tool">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Claude Code">
        ```bash
        claude mcp add --transport http outlit https://mcp.outlit.ai/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Claude Desktop">
        Add to your config file (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "outlit": {
              "url": "https://mcp.outlit.ai/mcp",
              "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        Restart Claude Desktop after saving.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Cursor">
        Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "outlit": {
              "url": "https://mcp.outlit.ai/mcp",
              "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key from Step 1.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the connection">
    Ask your AI tool:

    ```
    Show me the available Outlit analytics tables.
    ```

    You should see a list of available analytics tables. If you get an authentication error, double-check your API key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Treat your MCP API key like a password. It grants read access to your customer data. You can revoke keys at any time from the [MCP Integration settings](https://app.outlit.ai/workspace-profile/mcp).
</Warning>
