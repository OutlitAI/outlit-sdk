description: "How Outlit tracks visitors before they identify themselves"
---

## TL;DR

Most visitors browse your site anonymously before signing up or logging in. Outlit tracks their behavior from the first pageview and automatically connects that history to their profile when they identify themselves. This gives you complete visibility into the customer journey—from first touch to conversion.

## The Anonymous Phase

When someone visits your website for the first time:

1. **Visitor ID generated** - A UUID stored in localStorage and cookies
2. **Session begins** - First-touch attribution captured (UTM, referrer)
3. **Events tracked** - Pageviews, form views, button clicks
4. **Stored as AnonymousVisitor** - Ready to be linked later

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'dark', 'sequence': {'mirrorActors': false, 'messageMargin': 40}}}%%
sequenceDiagram
    participant V as Visitor
    participant B as Browser
    participant O as Outlit

    V->>B: First visit
    B->>B: Generate visitorId
    B->>O: Pageview event
    O->>O: Create AnonymousVisitor

    V->>B: Browse pages
    B->>O: More pageviews

    V->>B: Submit form with email
    B->>O: Identify event
    O->>O: Create/find CustomerContact
    O->>O: Link AnonymousVisitor → Contact
    O->>O: Convert events to timeline
```

## What's Captured?

### Automatic Attribution

On first visit, Outlit captures:

| Data | Source | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| UTM Source | URL params | `utm_source=google` |
| UTM Medium | URL params | `utm_medium=cpc` |
| UTM Campaign | URL params | `utm_campaign=spring_2024` |
| First Referrer | HTTP header | `https://google.com` |
| First Landing Page | URL | `/pricing?plan=pro` |
| IP Address | Request | For company enrichment |

### Events Stored

All events are stored for anonymous visitors and will be linked when they identify:

```typescript
// All these are tracked for anonymous visitors
outlit.track('pricing_viewed', { plan: 'enterprise' })
outlit.track('demo_video_played', { duration: 120 })
outlit.track('feature_explored', { feature: 'integrations' })
```

### Form Data

Form submissions are captured with automatic sanitization:

```json
{
  "type": "form",
  "formId": "contact-form",
  "formFields": {
    "email": "jane@acme.com",
    "name": "Jane",
    "company": "Acme Inc"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Sensitive fields (password, credit_card, SSN, etc.) are automatically removed from form data.
</Note>

## What Triggers Identity Resolution?

When `identify()` is called, the anonymous history is linked:

```typescript
// This triggers identity resolution
outlit.identify({
  email: 'jane@acme.com',
  traits: { name: 'Jane Doe' }
})
```

Here's what happens:

1. **Find or create contact** with the provided email
2. **Link the anonymous visitor** to the contact
3. **Historical events are processed**:
   - All previous events are added to the customer timeline
   - Original timestamps are preserved
   - The complete journey is now visible

### Timeline After Resolution

```
Jane Doe (jane@acme.com) - Customer Timeline
├── Mar 1, 10:00am - First visited /pricing (anonymous)
├── Mar 1, 10:05am - Viewed enterprise plan (anonymous)
├── Mar 1, 10:10am - Watched demo video (anonymous)
├── Mar 3, 2:00pm  - Returned, viewed /features (anonymous)
├── Mar 3, 2:15pm  - Submitted contact form ← IDENTIFIED
├── Mar 3, 2:20pm  - Viewed /signup
└── Mar 3, 2:25pm  - Created account
```

## How Does Cross-Device Tracking Work?

Anonymous tracking is per-browser. The same person on different devices has different visitor IDs until identified. Once someone calls `identify()` with the same email on multiple devices, all those histories merge into a single unified profile.

<Tip>
  **Edge cases**: If visitors clear cookies, use incognito mode, or share browsers, they may generate new visitor IDs. Call `identify()` immediately after login—even for returning users—to ensure continuity and accurate tracking.
</Tip>

## Company Enrichment

For B2B companies, knowing *which companies* are visiting your website—even before anyone fills out a form—is valuable sales intelligence. Outlit can automatically identify the company behind anonymous visitors.

### How It Works

When a visitor lands on your site:

1. **IP address is captured** with the first pageview
2. **Company lookup runs** in the background using [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io)
3. **If a company is identified**, a new customer record is created in your dashboard
4. **Browsing activity is linked** so you can see what pages they viewed

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'dark', 'flowchart': {'nodeSpacing': 50, 'rankSpacing': 60, 'curve': 'basis', 'padding': 15}}}%%
flowchart LR
    A([Anonymous Visitor]) -->|IP address| B([IPinfo Lookup])
    B -->|Company identified| C([Customer Created])
    C --> D([See in Dashboard])
    B -->|No company match| E([Stays Anonymous])
```

### What You'll See

When enrichment succeeds, you'll find a new customer in your dashboard with:

- **Company name and domain** from the IP lookup
- **First landing page** showing where they entered your site
- **Attribution data** like referrer and UTM parameters

This gives you visibility into companies showing interest—before they've even reached out.

### Privacy by Design

We intentionally **do not deanonymize individual visitors**. Company enrichment tells you "someone from Acme Inc visited your pricing page"—not *who* that person is.

This approach:

- **Respects individual privacy** - No attempt to identify the specific person
- **Focuses on company-level signals** - Which is what matters for B2B sales
- **Filters out noise** - ISPs, VPNs, and low-confidence matches are excluded
- **Only uses IP for company lookup** - The raw IP address is not stored after enrichment

<Info>
  Since enrichment only reveals company-level information, no individual contact is created. A contact is only created when someone actively identifies themselves (form submission, signup, etc.).
</Info>

### When Enrichment Happens

Not every visitor can be enriched. Outlit only creates a customer record when:

- The IP address maps to a **business, education, or government network**
- The match confidence is **high enough** to be reliable
- The company has a **valid domain** we can associate

Visitors from residential ISPs, coffee shops, VPNs, or hosting providers are intentionally excluded to avoid false positives.

<Note>
  Company enrichment is available on certain plans. Contact us to enable it for your workspace.
</Note>

## Device Tracking (Non-Browser)

For native apps without browser storage (desktop apps, mobile apps, CLI tools), use `fingerprint` instead of `visitorId`. A fingerprint is a device identifier that you generate and manage.

### When to Use Fingerprint

| Environment | Use |
|-------------|-----|
| Desktop apps (Tauri, Electron) | `fingerprint` |
| Mobile apps (React Native) | `fingerprint` |
| CLI tools | `fingerprint` |
| Browser/Webview | `visitorId` (automatic) |

### How It Differs from visitorId

| | visitorId | fingerprint |
|--|-----------|-------------|
| Generated by | SDK (automatic) | You (manual) |
| Stored in | localStorage + cookies | Your app (you decide) |
| SDKs | Browser SDK | Rust SDK, Node SDK |

### Generating a Fingerprint

Use any persistent, unique identifier for the device or installation:

- **Device UUID** - Hardware identifier
- **Installation ID** - Generated on first app launch, stored in app data
- **Keychain/Secure storage** - For sensitive apps

The fingerprint must be:
- Consistent across app sessions
- Unique per device/installation
- Stored persistently by your app

### Example: Tracking Before Sign-In

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Rust (Tauri)">
```rust
use outlit::{Outlit, fingerprint, email};

// Get or generate device fingerprint (store in app data)
let device_id = get_or_create_device_id();

// Track anonymously
client.track_by_fingerprint("feature_used", fingerprint(&device_id))
    .property("feature", "export")
    .send()
    .await?;

// Later, when user signs in
client.identify(email("user@example.com"))
    .fingerprint(&device_id)
    .send()
    .await?;
// ^ All previous fingerprint events are now linked to this user
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js (React Native)">
```typescript
import { Outlit } from '@outlit/node'

// Get or generate device fingerprint
const deviceId = await getOrCreateDeviceId()

// Track anonymously
outlit.track({
  fingerprint: deviceId,
  eventName: 'feature_used',
  properties: { feature: 'export' }
})

// Later, when user signs in
outlit.identify({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  fingerprint: deviceId
})
// ^ All previous fingerprint events are now linked to this user
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  Events tracked with only a fingerprint are stored but not visible in customer timelines until linked via `identify()`. Once linked, they appear with their original timestamps.
</Info>

## Privacy Considerations

Anonymous visitor data is retained for 90 days (configurable) for unidentified visitors. Once identified, data is linked to the customer and retained per your policy.

For GDPR compliance: anonymous data can be deleted on request, visitor IDs are pseudonymous (not directly identifying), IP addresses are used only for company lookup and not stored afterward, and there is no cross-site tracking.

To respect opt-out preferences, check for consent before initializing:

```typescript
if (!hasTrackingConsent()) {
  return // Don't initialize tracker
}

outlit.init({ publicKey: 'pk_xxx' })
```
