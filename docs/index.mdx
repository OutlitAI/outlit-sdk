## The Customer Context Layer

Outlit unifies every customer interaction — website visits, product usage, billing events — into a single [customer context graph](/concepts/customer-context-graph). Query the complete picture from the CLI, through AI agents, or via API.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collect">
    Add the Outlit browser SDK to capture website visits, form submissions, and engagement. Connect Stripe for billing data and PostHog for product usage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolve">
    Identity resolution automatically links anonymous visitors to known contacts when they sign up, log in, or submit a form. The same person across devices merges into one profile.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build the Graph">
    Outlit connects visitors, contacts, and accounts into a structured graph with journey stages, billing statuses, and unified activity timelines.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Query">
    Use the CLI, AI agents (via MCP), or the API to query your complete customer context — no dashboard required.
  </Step>
</Steps>
