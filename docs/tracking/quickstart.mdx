## What is Outlit?

Outlit is a customer context layer that unifies website visits, product usage, and billing events into a single queryable graph. You install it with the CLI, add a lightweight tracker to your site, and immediately start querying customer data from the terminal or through AI agents.

## Step 1: Install the CLI

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install -g @outlit/cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Homebrew">
    ```bash
    brew install outlitai/tap/outlit
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Binary">
    Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OutlitAI/outlit-sdk/releases) and add it to your `PATH`.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Authenticate

If you already have an account:

```bash
outlit auth login
```

New to Outlit? Sign up directly from the terminal:

```bash
outlit auth signup
```

<Info>
  The CLI stores your API key securely at `~/.config/outlit/credentials.json` with `0600` permissions. You can also pass a key directly with `--key` or set the `OUTLIT_API_KEY` environment variable.
</Info>

## Step 3: Connect a Data Source

The browser SDK is the most common first integration — it captures website visits, form submissions, and engagement automatically. Choose your framework to get started:

</Tip>

<Warning>
  Outlit uses cookies to track visitors across pages. If you need GDPR compliance, show a consent banner before loading the tracker. [See consent management →](/tracking/browser/script#consent-management)
</Warning>

## Step 4: Query Your Data

Once the tracker is live and you have some traffic, use the CLI to explore:

```bash
# List your customers
outlit customers list

# See a customer's full timeline
outlit customers timeline acme.com

# Search with natural language
outlit search "who signed up this week"

# Run SQL directly
outlit sql "SELECT domain, billing_status, mrr_cents FROM customers ORDER BY mrr_cents DESC LIMIT 10"
```

<Tip>
  **Set up AI agents** to query customer context directly from Cursor, Claude Code, or VS Code:

  ```bash
  outlit setup --yes
  ```

  This auto-detects installed agents and configures MCP access. See [AI Agent Setup →](/cli/ai-agents)
</Tip>

## What happens automatically?

Once the browser SDK is installed, Outlit captures without any additional code:

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| **Pageviews** | Every page navigation, with URL, title, and referrer |
| **Form submissions** | Field values with automatic sensitive-field sanitization |
| **Identity** | Auto-identifies visitors when forms contain an email field |
| **Engagement time** | Active time on each page (not just tab-open time) |
| **Attribution** | UTM parameters, referrer, and landing page on first visit |
| **Company enrichment** | IP-based company identification for B2B visitor intelligence |
