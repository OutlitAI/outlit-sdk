## Overview

Outlit automatically detects when visitors complete bookings through embedded calendar widgets from **Cal.com** and **Calendly**. No extra code required—just install the tracking snippet and booking events are captured.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Detection Method |
|----------|-----------------|
| Cal.com | Cal.com embed API |
| Calendly | Calendly postMessage events |

## What Gets Tracked

When a visitor books a meeting, Outlit captures:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `provider` | `"cal.com"` or `"calendly"` |
| `eventType` | Meeting title (e.g., "30 Minute Demo") |
| `startTime` | Scheduled start time (ISO format) |
| `endTime` | Scheduled end time (ISO format) |
| `duration` | Meeting length in minutes |

<Info>
  Calendar booking events appear in your timeline as "Meeting Requested" activities—distinct from calendar sync events, so you won't see duplicates.
</Info>

## Configuration

Calendar embed tracking is **enabled by default**. To disable it:

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.outlit.ai/stable/outlit.js"
  data-public-key="pk_your_public_key"
  data-track-calendar-embeds="false"
  async
></script>
```

<ParamField path="data-track-calendar-embeds" type="string">
  Set to `"false"` to disable automatic calendar booking detection.
</ParamField>

## Limitations

<Warning>
  **Auto-identify is not available** for calendar embed bookings. Cal.com and Calendly do not expose attendee email or name in their client-side events for privacy reasons.
</Warning>

To identify visitors who book meetings, use **webhooks** from your calendar provider:

1. Set up a webhook in Cal.com or Calendly
2. Receive the booking details (including email) on your server
3. Call the Outlit API to identify the visitor

```javascript
// Server-side: after receiving webhook
await outlit.identify({
  email: webhookData.attendee.email,
  traits: {
    name: webhookData.attendee.name,
    bookedMeeting: webhookData.eventType
  }
})
```

## Example Timeline

A typical visitor journey with calendar booking:

1. **Pageview** — Visitor lands on `/demo`
2. **Calendar Booking** — Visitor books "30 Minute Demo" via Cal.com embed
3. **Identify** — Your webhook handler identifies the visitor with their email

All three events are linked to the same visitor, giving you full context.
